<h4>What Is <b>ranchan</b>?</h4>
<p><i>random-chan</i>, or <i>ranchan</i> for short, is a simple web client which sets out to aggregate threads from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard">imageboard websites</a> (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.4chan.org/">4chan</a>) into a single page, serving them to users in a random and entertaining manner. Images, which correspond to threads, pop up on the page for a limited time; clicking on an image will open its thread in a new tab. By introducing a limited set of controls and preferences, users can fine tune their experience from a purely random search across all *chan sites, to one which more closely matches the sites, interests, and interactions they choose. With the elimination of title and caption text, deciding to visit a thread becomes much more about what is visually appealing and consumable, with the actual content of a thread serving as the reward for a user's curiosity.</p>
<h4>How come the site is so <b>slow/broken/bad/etc</b>?</h4>
<p>The site is currently in <span class='meta-phase'></span> (version <span class='meta-version'></span>), and as such is by no means optimized- there will be bugs and the mobile/tablet responsiveness is probably awful (don't even want to check). The current focus of the site's development is integrating features as quickly as possible. Once all features are implemented to some degree of functionality, the focus will shift towards debugging, optimizations, and responsiveness, which should help immensely as the site (and its contents) are almost completely dynamically generated.</p>
<h4>Why does this even <b>exist</b>?</h4>
<p>Fuck man I don't know.</p>
