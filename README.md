# ranchan
> Random thread discovery client for *chan boards

*random-chan*, or *ranchan* for short, sets out to aggregate threads from all across the internet into one page and serve them to users in a novel manner. By introducing a verbose set of controls and preferences, users can fine tune their experience from a purely random search across all *chan boards, to one which matches the sites, interests, and interactions they choose. With the elimination of title and caption text, selecting threads to visit becomes much more about what is visually appealing and consumable, with the actual topic of discussion acting as the reward for a user's intrigue.

By default, the site's background consists of title banners scraped from 4chan covered with a colored filter, while the foreground hosts thumbnails that can be clicked to open their corresponding threads.
